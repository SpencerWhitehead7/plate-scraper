Balsamic Mushroom

Ingredients

8 oz. spaghetti (fettuccine or similar noodles)
2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
2 Tbsp. unsalted butter
1 small yellow onion (finely chopped)
16 oz. cremini mushrooms (sliced)
4 cloves garlic (minced)
1/2 tsp. kosher salt
1/4 tsp. black pepper
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar (good quality)
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese (freshly grated, plus, additional for serving)
1/4 cup fresh parsley (chopped)

Instructions

Bring salted water to boil in an 8.0-Quart Stock Pot from the KitchenAid® Stainless Steel 8-Piece Set. Add the pasta to the KitchenAid® Pasta Insert and cook until slightly under al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water. Drain and set aside.

In a large, deep nonstick skillet, heat the olive oil and butter over medium. Once the oil is hot and the butter is melted, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms begin to soften and give up their liquid, about 7 minutes. Add the garlic, salt, and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 1 additional minute. Stir in the balsamic vinegar.

Add the drained pasta noodles, the reserved 1/2 cup pasta water, and the 1/2 cup parmesan to the skillet. Turn the heat to high. Toss until the pasta is glossy and the noodles are evenly coated. Stir in the parsley. Taste and add additional salt and pepper as desired. Serve warm, sprinkled with additional Parmesan cheese.
