Amazing Yorkies

Ingredients

vegetable oil
2 large free-range eggs
100 g plain flour
100 ml milk

Instructions

Preheat the oven to 225°C/425°F/gas 9.

Get yourself a cupcake tin and add a tiny splash of vegetable oil into each of the 12 compartments.

Pop into the oven for 10 to 15 minutes so the oil gets really hot.

Meanwhile, beat the eggs, flour, milk and a pinch of salt and pepper together in a jug until light and smooth.

Carefully remove the tray from the oven, then confidently pour the batter evenly into the compartments.

Pop the tray back in the oven to cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or until risen and golden.
