// Watermelon Mint Frosé

// Ingredients

// 1 (750-ml) bottle rosé wine (preferably something on the darker, bolder side)
// 1 pound watermelon cubes
// 1/2 cup granulated sugar
// 1/2 cup water
// 8 to 10 fresh mint leaves, plus more for garnish
// 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice

// Instructions

// Pour the rosé into ice cube trays and freeze until solid, at least 6 hours or preferably overnight. At the same time, place the watermelon on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and arrange them so that the cubes are not touching each other. Freeze for at least 2 hours, then transfer the watermelon into a container or zip-top bag and keep frozen. Meanwhile, make the mint simple syrup.

// Place the sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly until dissolved. Add the mint and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn off the heat and let sit for 15 minutes. Strain the syrup into a small bowl, discard the mint leaves, and let the syrup cool before refrigerating until ready to make the drink.

// Place the rosé ice cubes, frozen watermelon, mint simple syrup, and lemon juice in a blender and blend until combined and creamy. Pour into glasses and garnish each glass with a sprig of mint.
