Shaved Artichoke Salad with Shrimp

Ingredients

1 lemon, halved
12 small to medium artichokes
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons torn fresh mint leaves
Pinch of salt
¼ teaspoon ground pepper, divided
½ pound large shrimp (26-30 per pound), peeled and deveined

Instructions

Squeeze a lemon half into a bowl of cold water. Cut stems from artichokes and discard. Working with one artichoke at a time, pull off all the leaves and soft purple petals and discard. Using a sharp paring knife, trim any remaining green parts from the heart. Rub with the cut side of the remaining lemon half. Scoop out the fuzzy choke with a melon baller or spoon. Rub again with the lemon half. Place the artichoke heart in the lemon water to prevent discoloration while you trim the rest.

Very thinly slice the artichoke hearts and immediately toss them in a bowl with 2 tablespoons oil, mint, salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper.

Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are pink, 3 to 4 minutes.

Serve the shrimp with the artichokes and garnished with more mint, if desired.
