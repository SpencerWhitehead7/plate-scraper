Grilled Crispy-Skinned Salmon With Whole Lemon-Sesame Sauce

Ingredients

4 6-oz. skin-on salmon fillets, pin bones removed, patted dry
2 Tbsp. plus ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for grill
Kosher salt
1 small lemon
1 small shallot, finely chopped
2 tsp. black sesame seeds
1 tsp. honey
½ tsp. toasted sesame oil
Freshly ground black pepper
1 cup torn basil leaves

Instructions

Prepare a grill for medium heat. Rub salmon with 2 Tbsp. olive oil; season both sides with salt.

Cut ends off lemon and discard. Place lemon upright and slice off outer lobes in 4 sections, leaving a square-shaped core and seeds behind. Finely chop lobes (flesh, pith, and all) and transfer to a small bowl (you should have about ⅓ cup). Squeeze out juice from core over bowl. Add shallot, sesame seeds, honey, sesame oil, and remaining ⅓ cup olive oil; season with salt and lots of pepper. Toss to combine.

Clean and oil grate, then immediately place salmon on grill skin side down. Cover grill and cook, skin side down the entire time, until skin is lightly charred and fish is opaque, 6–8 minutes. Transfer salmon to a plate and let cool slightly.

Divide salmon among plates. Top with basil. Spoon lemon-sesame sauce over.

One Pot Cheeseburger Pasta

Ingredients

1 yellow onion ($0.25)
1 Tbsp olive oil ($0.16)
1/2 lb. ground beef ($2.50)
2 Tbsp all-purpose flour ($0.02)
1 8oz. can tomato sauce ($0.29)
2 cups beef broth ($0.26)
1/2 lb. pasta shells, uncooked ($0.50)
4 oz. cheddar cheese, shredded ($0.75)
2 Tbsp hot dog relish ($0.16)
2 green onions, sliced (optional) ($0.20)

Instructions

Finely dice the onion. Add the onion, olive oil, and ground beef to a large deep skillet and sauté over medium heat until the beef is fully browned and the onion is soft and translucent. Drain off any excess fat, if needed.

Add the flour to the skillet and continue to stir and cook for one minute more. The flour will begin to coat the bottom of the skillet. Be careful not to let the flour burn.

Add the tomato sauce and beef broth to the skillet and stir to dissolve the flour off the bottom of the skillet.

Add the uncooked pasta to the skillet and stir to combine. The liquid in the skillet may not fully cover the pasta, but that is okay.

Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and let the liquid come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, give it a quick stir to loosen any pasta from the bottom of the skillet, replace the lid, and turn the heat down to low. Let the pasta simmer, stirring occasionally (always replacing the lid), for about 10 minutes, or until the pasta is tender and the sauce has thickened. Turn the heat off.

Add the shredded cheddar to the skillet and stir until it has melted into the sauce. Stir the hot dog relish into the sauce and then top with sliced green onions. Serve hot.

Spiced Chickpea Stew With Coconut and Turmeric

Ingredients

¼cup olive oil, plus more for serving
4garlic cloves, chopped
1large yellow onion, chopped
1(2-inch) piece ginger, finely chopped
Kosher salt and black pepper
1½teaspoons ground turmeric, plus more for serving
1teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving
2(15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
2(15-ounce) cans full-fat coconut milk
2cups vegetable or chicken stock
1bunch Swiss chard, kale or collard greens, stems removed, torn into bite-size pieces
1cup mint leaves, for serving
Yogurt, for serving (optional)
Toasted pita, lavash or other flatbread, for serving (optional)

Instructions

Heat ¼ cup oil in a large pot over medium. Add garlic, onion and ginger. Season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally until onion is translucent and starts to brown a little at the edges, 3 to 5 minutes.

Add 1½ teaspoons turmeric, 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, and the chickpeas, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, so the chickpeas sizzle and fry a bit in the spices and oil, until they’ve started to break down and get a little browned and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove about a cup of chickpeas and set aside for garnish.

Using a wooden spoon or spatula, further crush the remaining chickpeas slightly to release their starchy insides. (This will help thicken the stew.) Add coconut milk and stock, and season with salt and pepper.

Bring to a simmer, scraping up any bits that have formed on the bottom of the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until stew has thickened, 30 to 35 minutes. (Taste a chickpea or two, not just the liquid, to make sure they have simmered long enough to be as delicious as possible.) If after 30 to 35 minutes, you want the stew a bit thicker, keep simmering until you've reached your desired consistency. Determining perfect stew thickness is a personal journey!

Add greens and stir, making sure they’re submerged in the liquid. Cook until they wilt and soften, 3 to 7 minutes, depending on what you’re using. (Swiss chard and spinach will wilt and soften much faster than kale or collard greens.) Season again with salt and pepper.

Divide among bowls and top with mint, reserved chickpeas, a sprinkle of red-pepper flakes and a good drizzle of olive oil. Serve alongside yogurt and toasted pita if using; dust the yogurt with turmeric if you'd like.

Croque Monsieur Breakfast Casserole

Ingredients

1 large loaf country-style bread, cut into 1\" cubes
6 large eggs
1 cup half-and-half
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, plus more for pan
6 oz. shredded Gruyére (about 2 1/2 c.), divided
4 oz. ham, torn into 1\" pieces, divided
1/4 cup (30 g.) all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups whole milk
Pinch of ground nutmeg

Instructions

Preheat oven to 300°. On a baking sheet, spread bread in an even layer and bake until dried out and crispy, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.

In a large glass measuring cup, whisk eggs, half-and-half, and mustard; season with salt and pepper. Pour over toasted bread and toss to coat. Let soak 10 minutes.

Bake casserole until bread is crispy and golden and cheese is melted, 30 to 40 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a medium pot over medium heat, melt butter. Add flour and whisk into butter. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden and smells nutty, about 2 minutes. While whisking, slowly pour in milk and continue to whisk until smooth. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened enough to just coat a spoon, but not as thick as gravy, about 1 minute. Stir in nutmeg; season with salt and pepper.

Preheat broiler. Pour sauce over casserole and top with remaining 1 cup Gruyére.

Broil, watching closely, until cheese is melted and golden in spots, 2 to 5 minutes.

Espresso Caramel Sauce

Ingredients

1 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup cold water
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar (or lemon juice)
2/3 cup heavy cream, warmed
2 teaspoons instant espresso powder, plus more to taste
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste

Instructions

Add the sugar to a small, sturdy saucepan, then slowly pour the water on top. The goal is to get as few sugar granules as possible on the side of the pan; if you notice any, just use a wet pastry brush (or even your fingers) to push the granules back down.

Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Don’t stir at this point at all. As soon as the mixture goes from cloudy to clear, pour the cider vinegar evenly over the top.

While the sugar keeps cooking, stir the espresso powder and salt into the warm cream until combined.

When you start to notice the caramel turning golden in certain places, you can gently swirl the pan to encourage it to cook evenly, or even just rotate the pan on your burner. The goal is to disturb it as little as possible (mixing can cause crystallization—not what we want). As soon as the color is a deep, chestnutty brown, carefully pour in the espresso-cream while whisking. (It’ll splatter and steam, so be careful.) Cut the heat.

Let the caramel cool for a little while, until you can taste it, then adjust the salt and espresso powder accordingly.

You can serve this right away or keep it in the fridge, in a tightly sealed jar, for weeks.

New York-Style Pizza

Ingredients

22 1/2 ounces bread flour, plus more for dusting (638g; about 4 1/2 cups)
0.5 ounce granulated sugar (15g; about 1 1/2 tablespoons)
0.35 ounce kosher salt (10g; about 1 tablespoon)
0.35 ounce instant yeast (10g; about 2 teaspoons)
15 ounces lukewarm water (415g; about 1 3/4 cups) (see notes)
3 tablespoons (45ml) extra-virgin olive oil
1 batch New York style pizza sauce
1 pound grated full-fat dry mozzarella cheese (454g; about 4 cups), placed in freezer for at least 15 minutes

Instructions

Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in bowl of food processor. Pulse 3 to 4 times to incorporate. Add water and olive oil. Run food processor until mixture forms ball that rides around the bowl above the blade, about 15 seconds. Continue processing 15 seconds longer.

Transfer dough ball to lightly floured surface and knead once or twice by hand until smooth ball is formed. It should pass the windowpane test. Divide dough into three even portions and place each in a covered quart-sized deli container or in a zipper-lock freezer bag. Place in refrigerator and allow to rise at least 1 day, and up to 5.

At least two hours before baking, remove dough from refrigerator and shape into balls by gathering dough towards bottom and pinching shut. Flour well and place each dough ball in a separate medium mixing bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise at warm room temperature until roughly doubled in volume.

One hour before baking, adjust oven rack with pizza stone to middle position and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C). Turn single dough ball out onto lightly floured surface. Gently press out dough into rough 8-inch circle, leaving outer inch higher than the rest. Gently stretch dough by draping over knuckles to form a 12- to 14-inch circle about 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to pizza peel.

Spread approximately 2/3 cup sauce evenly over surface of crust, leaving 1/2- to 1-inch border along edge. Evenly spread 1/3 of cheese over sauce. Slide pizza onto baking stone and bake until cheese is melted with some browned spots and crust is golden brown and puffed, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to cutting board, slice, and serve immediately. Repeat with remaining two dough balls, remaining sauce, and remaining cheese.

Grilled Salmon With Peach Salsa

Ingredients

For the salmon:
1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons granulated garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons granulated onion
1 teaspoon light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Pinch cayenne
1 pound skin-on salmon filets (about 4 pieces)
2 to 3 tablespoons neutral cooking oil, such as grapeseed, avocado, or canola oil
For the salsa:
2 heaping cups diced peaches, unpeeled (about 3 medium peaches)
1 medium ripe avocado, diced
1/4 cup finely diced red onion
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
2 tablespoons finely minced jalapeno, optional
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
To serve:
Jalapeño slices, for garnish
Chopped cilantro, for garnish

Instructions

Whisk together paprika, garlic, onion, brown sugar, salt, pepper, and cayenne.

Sprinkle spice mixture evenly on all sides of the salmon. Refrigerate uncovered while making the salsa and preheating the grill, about 20 minutes.

In a medium bowl, mix together the peaches, avocado, onion, cilantro, jalapeño, lemon juice, and salt. Season to taste, adding more salt or jalapeño if you like. If your peaches are a bit tart, you can add a pinch of sugar.

Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to 500°F for at least 15 minutes, or until you can hold your hand above the grates for 2 to 3 seconds.

Brush all sides of the salmon with oil—about a tablespoon total. Brush a bit of oil onto the grill grates as well, ensuring that any fish touching the grates through the grill pan will easily lift away.

Place the salmon skin side up on the grill pan and transfer the pan to the grill. Close the lid and cook undisturbed for 2 to 3 minutes. Using a fish spatula or tongs, gently lift one corner of the fish. The grilled side should be opaque and show some sear marks. If not, check every minute or so until it is.

Gently, flip the fish to skin side down, close the lid, and grill for another 3 to 4 minutes. Open the lid and watch carefully until the fish is done, another 1 to 3 minutes. The salmon is perfectly cooked when the top and bottom are opaque and there is a nice translucent streak through the middle. (If you prefer your salmon more well-done, continue cooking to your preferred doneness.)

Remove from the grill and serve immediately. Top with peach salsa and cilantro and chilies for garnish.
