Skillet Chicken Stroganoff

Ingredients

1/4 cup Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 package (8 oz) white mushrooms, sliced
1 package (20 oz) boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 1/4 cups Progresso™ chicken broth (from 32-oz carton)
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 cup sour cream
Chopped Italian (flat-leaf) parsley, if desired
6 cups cooked egg noodles, if desired

Instructions

In small bowl, mix flour, paprika, salt and pepper; set aside.

In 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat; add onion and mushrooms. Cook 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender; transfer mixture to small bowl.

In same skillet, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter; add chicken, and cook 4 to 6 minutes, stirring frequently, until chicken starts to brown. Add onion and mushroom mixture back to skillet; sprinkle with flour mixture, stirring to coat. Slowly add chicken broth and Worcestershire sauce, stirring constantly.

Heat to simmering; reduce heat to medium-low, and cook 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened and chicken is cooked through. Remove from heat; stir in sour cream. Garnish with parsley. Serve mixture over cooked egg noodles.
