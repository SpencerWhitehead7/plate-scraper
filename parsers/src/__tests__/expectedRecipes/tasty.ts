Chicken & Biscuits Bake

Ingredients

6 tablespoons butter
1 onion, chopped
½ cup flour (60 g)
3 cups chicken broth (720 mL)
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 cup heavy cream (240 mL)
2 ½ cups frozen mixed vegetable (455 g)
1 rotisserie chicken, shredded
2 tubes biscuit dough, 8 biscuits each

Instructions

Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).

In a large pot over medium-high heat, melt the butter.

Add the onion, stir until softened. About 1 minute.

Whisk in the flour, stirring constantly to prevent the flour from browning. About 1 minute.

Whisk in the chicken broth, salt, and pepper. Continue to whisk until no lumps remain.

Whisk in the heavy cream. Bring to a light simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly. Test for additional salt/pepper.

Add the mixed vegetables and shredded chicken, stir until fully incorporated.

Transfer to a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) baking dish.

Evenly top with 12 pieces of biscuit dough (you will have extra biscuits, which can be baked off separately).

Bake in a preheated oven for 20 minutes, until the biscuits are golden and the gravy mixture is bubbling.

Cool slightly before serving.
