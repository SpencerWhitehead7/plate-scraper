Grilled Salmon With Peach Salsa

Ingredients

1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons granulated garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons granulated onion
1 teaspoon light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Pinch cayenne
1 pound skin-on salmon filets (about 4 pieces)
2 to 3 tablespoons neutral cooking oil, such as grapeseed, avocado, or canola oil
2 heaping cups diced peaches, unpeeled (about 3 medium peaches)
1 medium ripe avocado, diced
1/4 cup finely diced red onion
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
2 tablespoons finely minced jalapeno, optional
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
Jalapeño slices, for garnish
Chopped cilantro, for garnish

Instructions

Whisk together paprika, garlic, onion, brown sugar, salt, pepper, and cayenne.

Sprinkle spice mixture evenly on all sides of the salmon. Refrigerate uncovered while making the salsa and preheating the grill, about 20 minutes.

In a medium bowl, mix together the peaches, avocado, onion, cilantro, jalapeño, lemon juice, and salt. Season to taste, adding more salt or jalapeño if you like. If your peaches are a bit tart, you can add a pinch of sugar.

Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to 500°F for at least 15 minutes, or until you can hold your hand above the grates for 2 to 3 seconds.

Brush all sides of the salmon with oil—about a tablespoon total. Brush a bit of oil onto the grill grates as well, ensuring that any fish touching the grates through the grill pan will easily lift away.

Place the salmon skin side up on the grill pan and transfer the pan to the grill. Close the lid and cook undisturbed for 2 to 3 minutes. Using a fish spatula or tongs, gently lift one corner of the fish. The grilled side should be opaque and show some sear marks. If not, check every minute or so until it is.

Gently, flip the fish to skin side down, close the lid, and grill for another 3 to 4 minutes. Open the lid and watch carefully until the fish is done, another 1 to 3 minutes. The salmon is perfectly cooked when the top and bottom are opaque and there is a nice translucent streak through the middle. (If you prefer your salmon more well-done, continue cooking to your preferred doneness.)

Remove from the grill and serve immediately. Top with peach salsa and cilantro and chilies for garnish.
